# LIRI Bot

### Overview

This is a blatant attempt to rip off Apple.  It will replace Siri in a few months but we have an awsome
legal team so we are not worried!

### USAGE:  node liri.js <command> "<content>"   (important, use quotes if more than one word!)

* If command is empty instructions will print
* if command is spotify-this-song, it will search spotify for the content, (default if song empty)
* if command is concert-this, it will search for concerts from bandsintown.com  (error if bad is empty)
* if command is movie-this, it will search for movie info from omdb (defalt if movie title empty)
* if command is do-what-it-says, input will be taken from random.text per the above
